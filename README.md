# BearingDistance

Bearing Distance is a python based plugin for QGIS minimum version 3.18 that offers surveyors, cartographers and G.I.S analysts a method of generating bearing and distance of a polygon. 
This plugin also generates the coordinates of each corner of a polygon by creating a point shapefile.
The Bearing and Distance comes in a line shapelife and contains delail explanation within the attribute table.

### B & D(By Attribute_With Points)
This option allows a user to generate bearing and distance using a unique atrribute of a feature and also generate the bearing and distance using an existing point shapefile representing the beacons and its numbers.

### B & D(By Attribute_Without Points)
This option allows a user to generate bearing and distance using a unique atrribute of a feature and also generate the bearing and distance using a default numbering which starts from Point 1, Point 2, Point 3,...... and therfore does not require a point shapefile.
